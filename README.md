# ModIA
This repository gathers my courses, practical assignments, and projects from the ModIA double degree program between INSA and ENSEEIHT, completed during my 4th and 5th year of studies. It contains what I managed to save along the way (oupsi).
The main topics covered include applied mathematics, computer science, optimization, machine learning, data science, and artificial intelligence.

La bise,
