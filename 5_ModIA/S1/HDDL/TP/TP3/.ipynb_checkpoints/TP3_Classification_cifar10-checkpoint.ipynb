    "A confusion matrix is a very common metric used to summarize a classification problem's results. The information is presented as a table or matrix where one axis represents the ground truth labels for each class, and the other axis represents the predicted labels from the network. The entries in the table represent the number of instances from an experiment (sometimes represented as percentages rather than counts). Generating a confusion matrix in TensorFlow is accomplished by calling the _tf.math.confusion_matrix()_ function, which takes two required arguments: the list of ground truth labels and the associated predicted labels.\n",

When the input image is a dog (index 5), the most misclassified examples are cats, with 117 samples.\n",
