_Sentiment analysis through Recurrent Neural Networks_

---

In this tutorial, we are interested in the problem of sentiment analysis.
* In the first part, we will build a recurrent network on a toy dataset from scratch to determine if a sentence is positive or negative. 
* In a second step, using the [Keras](https://keras.io/) API, we will build a network able to determine if a movie review is positive or negative.
